Vignettes are long form documentation commonly included in packages. Because they are part of the distribution of the package, they need to be as compact as possible. The `html_vignette` output type provides a custom style sheet (and tweaks some options) to ensure that the resulting html is as small as possible. The `html_vignette` format:

- Never uses retina figures
- Has a smaller default figure size
- Uses a custom CSS stylesheet instead of the default Twitter Bootstrap style

## Vignette Info

Note the various macros within the `vignette` section of the metadata block above. These are required in order to instruct R how to build the vignette. Note that you should change the `title` field and the `\VignetteIndexEntry` to match the title of your vignette.

## Styles

The `html_vignette` template includes a basic CSS theme. To override this theme you can specify your own CSS in the document metadata as follows:

    output: 
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        css: mystyles.css

## Figures

The figure sizes have been customised so that you can easily put two images side-by-side. 

```{r, fig.show='hold'}
plot(1:10)
plot(10:1)
```

You can enable figure captions by `fig_caption: yes` in YAML:

    output:
      rmarkdown::html_vignette:
        fig_caption: yes

Then you can use the chunk option `fig.cap = "Your figure caption."` in **knitr**.

## More Examples

You can write math expressions, e.g. $Y = X\beta + \epsilon$, footnotes^[A footnote here.], and tables, e.g. using `knitr::kable()`.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
knitr::kable(head(mtcars, 10))
```

## 1. Background and motivation
The dataset is from Panitumumab Randomized Trial in Combination With Chemotherapy for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.
The study type is Interventional study. The study purpose is to get the treatment effect of panitumumab in combination with FOLFOX compared to FOLFOX alone as first line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. The treatment group is using drug of Panitumumab and FOLFOX regimen, the control group only use the drug of FOLFOX regimen. There are 1183 participants in the study, and they are allocated to either treatment group or control group randomly.
The primary outcome measure is progression-free survival (PFS). According to the study of the primary outcome, PFS in the Wild-type KRAS Efficacy Analysis Set was compared at a significance level of 5%.
and the secondary outcome measures include overall survival, percentage of participants with an objective response, time to progression, duration of response, and number of participants with adverse events (AEs).
Only people who are18 years and older are included in the study.

colSums(is.na(df))
```
According to the summary of missing value above, only "DIAGMONS", "B_HEIGHT", and "B_METANM" have missing value. We are not going to use these 3 variables in further analysis, so we are not going to remove the missing values of these 3 variables.

Below is the summary of outcomes (Death), assigned treatment, and possible confounders (AGE, SEX, and RACE).
```{r}
df |> 
  select(ATRT, DTH, AGE, SEX, RACE) |>
  tbl_summary()
```

```{r}
# Plot histogram of the AGE variable
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(df, aes(x=AGE)) + 
  geom_histogram(bins = 20)
print(max(df$AGE))
print(min(df$AGE))
```

```{r}
# Convert AGE (max = 85, min = 27) to categorical variable C_AGE
# Patients between 26 and 45 years old are assigned to group 1: "26-45", patients between 46 and 65 years old are assigned to group 2: "45-65", patients between 6 6and 85 years old are assigned to group 3: "66-85"
df$C_AGE <- "26-45"
df$C_AGE[df$AGE >45 & df$AGE <=65] <- "46-65"
df$C_AGE[df$AGE >=65] <- "66-85"
df$AGE1 <- ifelse(df$C_AGE == "26-45", 1, 0)
df$AGE2 <- ifelse(df$C_AGE == "46-65", 1, 0)

```

```{r}
# Summary of variable C_AGE
df |> 
  select(C_AGE) |>
  tbl_summary()
```



```{r}
library(aod)
mylogit <- glm(DTH ~ ATRT + SEX + C_AGE + RACE, data = df, family = "binomial")
summary(mylogit)
confint(mylogit)
#wald.test(b = coef(mylogit), Sigma = vcov(mylogit), Terms=1:9)
```
Then we apply logistic regression model to get a sense of the relationship between outcome and variables. Our primary focus has been the Actual Treatment.
